# Week 6 tutorial session

During this tutorial you will start to work on a web application based on javascript.

The platform given in the example code is a nodeJS app.

You will have to convert the prac05.html to the nodejs app and run it to show how you migrated the code.

You must create a seperate stylesheet file and built up the html code generation from the nodejs application.

Before you start on the tutorial, you have to [install nodejs on Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/sample-nodejs.html).



To get started with NodeJS, you can go through this [tutorial](https://nodejs.dev/learn/introduction-to-nodejs)

or

### Nodejs express code

You can follow the nodejs Express tutorial [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) to get a quick access to routing and page layout.

Once you have converted the file prac05.html to nodejs, you must commit the code to your github folder and submit the URL in the practical dropbox.

## You can use the same code base to start migrating your assignment 1 to nodejs.

## we will talk about assignment 2 during the lecture session.

Go to the examplecode folder and look at the code.

you can run the code by typing 

```
npm install
npm start
```
